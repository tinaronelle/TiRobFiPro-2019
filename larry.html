            <h3>About My Space</h3>
            <p class="bodytxt"> 
             My apartment building faces the busy Avenue, but I am in the back of the building.  
             That is good and bad.  It is good because it is quiet and away from the noise.  It is bad 
             because I do not get a tremendous amount of light.  My apartment is a reflection of my 
             love for art and artists.  I have a lot of pieces hanging on the walls that I have purchased
             while traveling all over the world.  I have a minimal sensibility and I love antiques.  
             I believe in having classic pieces that will last a lifetime. I guess you could say that my 
             color scheme is earthy.  My bathroom is bright red though. </p>

        <h3>My Favorite Room</h3>
        <p class="bodytxt">My favorite room is my living room. It is where I read, watch TV and listen to 
        music.  I have an extensive CD Collection and I have a stereo that I play records on.  I like to 
        entertain, so I have a lot of places for people to sit. I have a pair of curtains that I got from 
        Ikea that are shear and they go from floor to ceiling.  I love that I only payed a little bit of
        money for them, but they looks so rich and expensive.  I have an antique table and art that I 
        purchased from an amazing Mexican artist.  I hope to get more artwork when I travel for my birthday
        this year. I need some new pieces. </p>
