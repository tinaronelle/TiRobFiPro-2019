            <h3>About My Space</h3>
            <p class="bodytxt"> 
             I love my apartment.  It is pretty tiny but it is perfect for me any my two children.  
             They share a room and it is <style type="text/css">
                 
             </style>plit in half since one is a boy and one is a girl.  I live 
             in a building with a lot of young people, so it can get really loud at times.   Every space in my
             apartment is utilized and I wish had just a little more storage.  I have a great bathroom.  When my 
             friends come over and see it they are jealous that it is so large!  I am in show business so a lot of
             what is hung on the wall are posters and photographs from performances I have done.  That and pictures 
             of my kids, there are lots of pictures of them hanging.  I would like to collect more art.  One day I will 
             get around to that.  Purple is my favorite color so my apartment reflects that.</p>

        <h3>My Favorite Room</h3>
        <p class="bodytxt">That one is hard.  I have two favorite rooms!  I LOVE my bedroom.  It is tranquil and it
        works for me because I love to get a good sleep.  It is where I can get away when I need to and itâ€™s very 
        feminine.  I have a great bed also with great pillows.   I spent a lot of money on those!  I love my kitchen as well.
        I love to cook and stay in the kitchen when I am not working.  When I come home from tour, I realize how much 
        I miss my bed and my kitchen. There is definitely no place like home.
