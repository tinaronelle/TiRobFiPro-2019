            <h3>About My Space</h3>
            <p class="bodytxt"> 
            I live in a walk up building on the top floor in the last apartment, so it is pretty quiet.  
            I have two bedrooms, one I use for a spare den and sometimes bedroom.  There is one big bathroom 
            which is not at all modern but I do not mind because there is a lot of space.  I used to entertain 
            a lot but my schedule is so busy lately I have not had time to do much of that lately.  I like street
            art so I have a lot of unknown artists hanging on the wall. Also I have a lot of pictures of my family which 
            is really important to me.  I am into purples and lavenders, so my living room walls are that color.  </p>

        <h3>My Favorite Room</h3>
        <p class="bodytxt">My favorite room would have to be my living room.  It is where I spend the majority of my time 
        (when I am home) catching up on Netflix or listening to Jazz, which is my favorite type of music.  I have an amazing 
        couch, which is so comfy and large that I do almost everything on it.  I study, read, sometimes nap and sometimes 
        eat on it.  My living room windows are where I get the most light so that is another reason I spend a lot of time there.  
        Also, I love my plants and they are in my living room as well. </p>
